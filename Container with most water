Start with the widest container possible. Then try to improve height while gradually reducing width. Always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line.

Area depends on the minimum height. Moving the taller line won’t help,, height is still limited by the shorter one. To possibly increase area, 
we must try a taller line, move the shorter pointer.

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;      
        while (left < right) {
            int width = right - left;
            int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = width * h;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;}}
        return maxArea;}}
